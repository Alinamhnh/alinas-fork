# What does digital wellbeing mean?
## Digital wellbeing refers to the state of optimal balance between **connectivity and disconnectivity** in online world. 
It encompasses various aspects of wellbeing, such as physical, mental, and social wellbeing, in the context of digital environments.
Vanden Abeele defines the concept of wellbeing as "subjective individual experience of optimal **balance between the benefits and
drawnbacks obtained from mobile connectivity**. This experimental state is comprised of affective and cognitive appraisals of the
integration of digital connectivity into ordinary life [...]." (Vanden Abeele 2021, p.938)

# Why is digital wellbeing challenging?
## In today's increasingly digitalized world, people are constantly connected and engaged with various digital devices, platforms, and online activities. 
While these technologies offer numerous benefits and opportunities, they also present challenges and potential negative impacts on
individuals' wellbeing. Issues such as **excessive screen time, social media comparison, cyberbullying, information overload, and
digital addiction** have gained attention due to their adverse effects on individuals' health and happiness.

# How to reach digital wellbeing?
## Digital wellbeing recognizes the need for individuals to cultivate a healthy and balanced relationship with technology. 
It involves developing conscious and mindful **digital habits, setting boundaries, and practicing self-regulation** to ensure that technology use enhances rather than detracts from wellbeing. This includes practices such as practicing digital detoxes, managing notifications,setting limits on screen time, and prioritizing offline activities and relationships.

Any Questions?

## Prepare for the next session

To prepare for the next session, please read the paper by @vandenabeeleDigitalWellbeingDynamic2021. 

<br><br>

After you have finished reading, try to answer the following questions:

- What is a good definition of digital well-being? How might this be associated
with the concept of *autonomy*?
- Take a look at the table on pp. 941-942. Do you understand what all of the
described factors mean? If not, try to find out and write down what you have
found. If you are still not sure, write this down as well and bring your
questions to the next session.

### Definition of Digital Well-Being

> "Digital wellbeing is a **subjective individual experience** of optimal balance between the benefits and drawbacks obtained from mobile connectivity. This experiential state is comprised of **affective and cognitive appraisals** of the integration of digital connectivity into ordinary life. People achieve digital wellbeing when experiencing maximal **controlled pleasure and functional support**, together with **minimal loss of control and functional impairment.**"

### What are "Demands"?

Lack of theoretical integration of the role of technological influencing factors in digital media use

- Affordances? [@karahannaNeedsAffordancesFeatures2018]

- "Cold" Affordances? [@trepteSocialMediaPrivacy2015]

### Literature Review of Digital Autonomy

**Problem:** Very broad construct, very much literature, how to narrow down?

:::fragment
- Citation Chasing?
- Autonomy ["Concept"](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q484105)?
- (Computational) Scoping Review
:::

:::fragment
**Step 1: Gain an overview with the help of Topic Modeling...**
:::

***

**What is Topic Modeling?**

- A corpus consists of $D$ documents und $V$ words (or terms): bag-of-words approach
- Assumption: there are latent clusters of topics $K$ which occur to varying degrees within $D$ and are indicated by specific words $w$ which belong to each $K$ with a specific probability
- Goal is the computation of two matrices: $D*K$ and $V*K$

General Overview [@maierApplyingLDATopic2018, 94]

![](img/02_mcparadox/top_mod.jpg){height=300px}

- $\phi$ = Word-topic assignment matrix
- $\theta$ = Document-topic assignment matrix


## Computational Scoping Review

![Topic model (*k* = 14) with corresponding top words (i.e., highest β probability for topic) and most likely OpenAlex concepts (highest level and probability score). Relative topic prevalence γ over entire corpus (n = 1744). Topic labels in grey boxes based on qualitative assessment.](img/02_mcparadox/tm.png)

## Goals and Research Questions

**Goal 1: Integrating Human Computer Interaction and Communication Research**

- **RQ1**: What are the *mechanisms* that are proposed to connect digital media use and autonomy need experiences?

**Goal 2: Integrating Other Perspectives on Digital Autonomy**

- **RQ2**: Which *research perspectives* can be identified in the study of digital autonomy?
- **RQ3**: What are the *theoretical approaches* that are used by these perspectives and how do they relate to each other?
- **RQ4**: Which of these perspectives focus on *individual perceptions* of digital autonomy or *autonomy need experiences* that relate to digital media use?
- **RQ5**: How are individual perceptions of digital autonomy or autonomy need experiences that relate to digital media use *studied empirically*?

Any Questions?
:::

## Prepare for the next session

To prepare for the next session, please read the paper by @vansteenkisteBasicPsychologicalNeeds2023. 

<br><br>

After you have finished reading, try to answer the following questions:

- How can we define autonomy need experiences?
- How do the key criteria of BPNT described within the chapter relate to digital media use? What might be implications for studying digital autonomy?
- Can you think of examples that are similar to the empirical studies described in the chapter, but relate to digital media use?
- Did you find anything odd while reading the chapter? Can you identify aspects that might be worthy of critique?

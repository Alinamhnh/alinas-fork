**Mandatory**

To prepare for the next session, please read the following paper:

After you have finished reading, try to answer the following questions:

- What is a good definition of digital well-being? How might this be associated
with the concept of *autonomy*?
- Take a look at the table on pp. 941-942. Do you understand what all of the
described factors mean? If not, try to find out and write down what you have
found. If you are still not sure, write this down as well and bring your
questions to the next session.
